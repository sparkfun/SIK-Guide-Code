SparkFun Inventor's Kit (SIK)
Example sketches

These sketches are part of the SparkFun Inventor's Kit aka SIK (http://learn.sparkfun.com/products/2). The SIK consists of an Arduino microcontroller (http://www.arduino.com), and a variety of electronic components designed to help you learn basic programming and circuits. Once you've mastered these circuits, you'll be able to start building projects limited only by your imagination!

These sketches are designed to be used along with the SIK Guide, (http://dlnmh9ip6v2uc.cloudfront.net/datasheets/Kits/SFE03-0012-SIK.Guide-300dpi-01.pdf), which has illustrations of the circuit layout and other useful information.

Installation:

1. If you haven't yet, install the Arduino IDE (http://www.arduino.cc)
2. Download the latest SIK Guide Code (http://sparkfun.com/sikcode)
3. Unzip the above file.
4. Place the "SIK Guide Code" folder in the Arduino IDE "examples" directory:
   PC: drag the "SIK Guide Code" folder into C:\program files\Arduino-x\examples
   MAC: drag the "SIK Guide Code" folder into Arduino-x/Contents/Resource/Java/examples
	 Linux: see http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Learning/Linux
5. Start the Arduino IDE; the examples should be visible in File/Examples/SIK Guide Code

Sketch topics:

1.  Blinking an LED
2.  Potentiometer (knob)
3.  RGB (Red Green Blue) LED
4.  Multiple LEDs
5.  Push buttons
6.  Photoresistor (light sensor)
7.  Temperature sensor
8.  Servomotor
9.  Flex sensor
10. Soft potentiometer
11. Buzzer
12. Motor

New concepts:

1.  Basic sketch structure, comments, digital outputs, LED and resistor, delay
2.  Potentiometer (knob), analog input, variables
3.  RGB LED, constant values, "for" loops, if/else, user functions, PWM (analogWrite)
4.   Multiple LEDs, arrays of data, calling user-written functions, random numbers
5.  Pushbuttons, digital input, complex logic
6.  Photoresistor, making voltage dividers for resistive sensors
7.  Temperature sensor, serial monitor, floating-point numbers, functions returning values
8.  Servomotor, code libraries
9.  Flex sensor, input to output, map and constrain
10. Soft potentiometer, more complex value mapping, nesting math functions
11. Buzzer, tone generation, searching arrays
12. DC motor, transistor, flyback (protection) diode, serial numeric input
13. Relays, switch contacts, normally-open (NO), normally-closed (NC)
14. Shift register chip, SPI, bits and binary numbers

These sketches were written by SparkFun Electronics, with lots of help from the Arduino community. This code is completely free for any use.
