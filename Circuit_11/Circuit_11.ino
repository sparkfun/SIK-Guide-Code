BUZZER

  Use the buzzer to play a song!

  The buzzer in your Inventor's Kit is an electromechanical
  component you can use to make noise. Inside the buzzer is a
  coil of wire and a small magnet. When current flows through
  the coil, it becomes magnetized and pulls towards the magnet,
  creating a tiny "click". When you do this thousands of times
  per second, you create tones.

  The Arduino has a built-in command called tone() which clicks
  the buzzer at a certain frequency. This sketch knows the
  frequencies of the common notes, allowing you to create songs.
  We're never going to let you down!

Hardware connections:

  The buzzer has two pins. One is positive and one is negative.
  The postitive pin is marked by a "+" symbol on both the top
  and bottom of the buzzer.

  Connect the positive pin to Arduino digital pin 9.
  (Note that this must be a PWM pin.)
  Connect the negative pin to GND.

  Tip: if the buzzer doesn't fit into the breadboard easily,
  try rotating it slightly to fit into diagonal holes.

/*
This sketch uses the buzzer to play songs.
The Arduino's tone() command will play notes of a given frequency.
We'll provide a function that takes in note characters (a-g),
and returns the corresponding frequency from this table:

  note 	frequency
  c     262 Hz
  d     294 Hz
  e     330 Hz
  f     349 Hz
  g     392 Hz
  a     440 Hz
  b     494 Hz
  C     523 Hz
