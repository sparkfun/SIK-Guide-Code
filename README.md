*SparkFun Inventor's Kit for Arduino (KIT-11227)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/)

The example sketches in this repository are part of the SparkFun Inventor's Kit (a.k.a. *"The SIK"*). The SIK consists of an [Arduino microcontroller](http://www.arduino.com) and a variety of electronic components designed to help you learn basic programming and circuits. Once you've mastered these circuits, you'll be able to start building projects limited only by your imagination!

These sketches are designed to be used along with the [**SIK Guide**](http://dlnmh9ip6v2uc.cloudfront.net/datasheets/Kits/SFE03-0012-SIK.Guide-300dpi-01.pdf) which has illustrations of the circuit layout and other useful information.

Getting Started
---------------

1. If you haven't yet, download and install the [Arduino IDE](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
2. Obtain the latest SIK Guide Code by one of the following methods:
 * Clone this repository using Git ([New to Git? Click here.](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git))
 * Download this repository as a [zip file](https://github.com/sparkfun/SIK-Guide-Code/archive/master.zip) and unzip.
3. Place the `SIK-Guide-Code` folder in the Arduino IDE `examples` directory:
 * PC: drag the `SIK-Guide-Code` folder into `C:\program files\Arduino-x\examples`
 * MAC: drag the `SIK-Guide-Code` folder into `Arduino-x/Contents/Resource/Java/examples`
 * Linux: see [http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Learning/Linux](http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Learning/Linux)
4. Start the Arduino IDE; the examples should be visible in this menu: `File > Examples > SIK Guide Code`
