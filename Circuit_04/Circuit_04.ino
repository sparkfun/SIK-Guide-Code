MULTIPLE LEDs

  Make eight LEDs dance. Dance LEDs, dance!

Hardware connections:

  You'll need eight LEDs, and eight 330 Ohm resistors
  (orange-orange-brown).
	
    For each LED, connect the negative side (shorter leg)
    to a 330 Ohm resistor.
  
    Connect the other side of the resistors to GND.
  
    Connect the positive side (longer leg) of the LEDs
    to Arduino digital pins 2 through 9.

This sketch was written by SparkFun Electronics,
with lots of help from the Arduino community.
This code is completely free for any use.

// To keep track of all the LED pins, we'll use an "array".
// An array lets you store a group of variables, and refer to them
// by their position, or "index". Here we're creating an array of
// eight integers, and initializing them to a set of values:

int ledPins[] = {2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9};

// The first element of an array is index 0.
// We've put the value "2" in index 0, "3" in index 1, etc.
// The final index in the above array is 7, which contains
// the value "9".

// We're using the values in this array to specify the pin numbers
// that the eight LEDs are connected to. LED 0 is connected to 
// pin 2, LED 1 is connected to pin 3, etc.


void setup()
{
  int index;
  
  // In this sketch, we'll use "for() loops" to step variables from
  // one value to another, and perform a set of instructions for 
  // each step. For() loops are a very handy way to get numbers to
  // count up or down.

  // Every for() loop has three statements separated by
  // semicolons (;):

  //   1. Something to do before starting
  //   2. A test to perform; as long as it's true, keep looping
  //   3. Something to do after each loop (increase a variable)

  // For the for() loop below, these are the three statements:
  
  //   1. index = 0;    Before starting, make index = 0.
  //   2. index <= 7;   If index is less or equal to 7,
  //                    run the following code.
  //			(When index = 8, continue with the sketch.)
  //   3. index++	Putting "++" after a variable means
  //                    "add one to it".
  //			(You can also use "index = index + 1".)
  
  // Every time you go through the loop, the statements following
  // the for() (within the brackets) will run.
  
  // When the test in statement 2 is finally false, the sketch
  // will continue.


  // Here we'll use a for() loop to initialize all the LED pins
  // to outputs. This is much easier than writing eight separate
  // statements to do the same thing.

  // This for() loop will make index = 0, then run the pinMode()
  // statement within the brackets. It will then do the same thing
  // for index = 2, index = 3, etc. all the way to index = 7.

  for(index = 0; index <= 7; index++)
  {
    pinMode(ledPins[index],OUTPUT);
    // ledPins[index] is replaced by the value in the array.
    // For example, ledPins[0] is 2
  }
}


void loop()
{
  // This loop() calls functions that we've written further below.
  // We've disabled some of these by commenting them out (putting
  // "//" in front of them). To try different LED displays, remove
  // the "//" in front of the ones you'd like to run, and add "//"
  // in front of those you don't to comment out (and disable) those
  // lines.

  oneAfterAnotherNoLoop();  // Light up all the LEDs in turn
  
  //oneAfterAnotherLoop();  // Same as oneAfterAnotherNoLoop,
                            // but with much less typing

                            // scrolling down the line

/*
oneAfterAnotherNoLoop()

This function will light one LED, delay for delayTime, then light
the next LED, and repeat until all the LEDs are on. It will then
turn them off in the reverse order.

This function does NOT use a for() loop. We've done it the hard way
to show you how much easier life can be when you use for() loops.
Take a look at oneAfterAnotherLoop() further down, which does
exactly the same thing with much less typing.
